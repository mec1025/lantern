<h2>Business Owners: Prepare for Utility Disruptions</h2>

<p>Have a plan in place in case a natural disaster or other hazard knocks out your business's electricity or natural gas service.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Identify energy utilities - </strong>
The utilities that are absolutely necessary to running your business. How might a disaster impact the availability of those utilities?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Determine backup options - </strong>
Contact your utility companies to discuss potential backup options, such as portable generators to provide power.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Learn how and when to turn off utilities - </strong>
For example, if you turn off your natural gas, a professional technician must turn it back on.

</li>
<li>
<strong>Consider using backup generators - </strong>
Generators can power the most important aspects of your business in an emergency. This will involve:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Determining </strong>
how much power you'll need to operate vital systems and equipment during an emergency;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Choosing </strong>
the best type of generator, such as a diesel- or natural gas-fueled generator, or a commercial-grade generator;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Obtaining </strong>
any necessary Federal, State, or local permits required to use a generator;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Installing </strong>
the generator according to manufacturer instructions, utility specifications, and building safety codes;
</li>
<li>
Perhaps
<strong>pre-wiring </strong>
the generator to the building's essential electrical equipment;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintaining </strong>
service contracts and periodically testing the backup system to make sure it works; and
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintaining </strong>
adequate fuel supplies to power the backup system properly, and for several days if necessary.
