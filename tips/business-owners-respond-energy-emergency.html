<h2>Business Owners: Respond to an Energy Emergency</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ensure your building is safe to occupy - </strong>
Initially allow only essential, critical-operations staff into restricted areas. Ask your local or State health department for guidance on determining the safety of your building.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Decide whether to activate backup power - </strong>
If your backup generator doesn't automatically turn on during a power outage, you'll have to determine when to activate backup systems. First determine whether power is likely to be restored within 24 hours. If not, you may want to activate those systems to protect your business assets.

</li>
<li>
<strong>Contact your fuel supplier - </strong>
If you rely on fuel supplies for your business, vehicles, generators, and other equipment, contact your fuel supplier to confirm contractual arrangements during an emergency. Can your fuel supplier access your facility? Can it operate without power? You may need to contact a backup or out-of-region supplier if your normal supplier is unavailable due to the emergency.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stay informed - </strong>
Use cell phones, laptops, and other mobile devices to communicate with your utility companies, and to help you stay up to date on restoration efforts, weather forecasts, and other important information. Industry associations like the Automobile Association of America distribute information about gasoline and diesel fuel availability and prices, as does GasBuddy.com. Stay tuned also to local media reports, and for information from State and local government sources.

State and Federal organizations may offer assistance with disaster preparedness planning and recovery, loans, grants, and other resources.
