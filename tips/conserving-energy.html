<h2>Conserving Energy</h2>
<p>During an energy emergency, customers can reduce stress on infrastructure by conserving energy. This will help you and your community recover more quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Officials can ask the public</strong>
to conserve energy, including:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cutting back</strong>
on driving, using public transportation, and telecommuting when possible;
</li>
<li>
<strong>Refraining </strong>
from using non-essential lights and appliances, especially during peak hours (typically around 4:00âˆ’6:00 p.m.); and
</li>
<li>
<strong>Lowering </strong>
thermostat and water heating settings.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Officials can ask transmission operators</strong>
to activate demand-response programs in regions where those programs have been established. Under these programs, end-users are compensated to reduce their demand on the system upon notice by the operator.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Officials may impose restrictions</strong>
on the hours during which commercial, industrial, public, and school buildings may be open, on lighting levels, on interior temperature, and on the use of display and decorative lighting.
</li>
</ul>
