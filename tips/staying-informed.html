<h2>Staying Informed</h2>
<p>Staying informed during an energy emergency will help you stay safe and know best how to respond.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pay close attention to reports</strong>
from officials and energy suppliers using battery-operated radios, computers, mobile phones, other mobile devices, and even newspapers, if you have access to them. Officials and energy suppliers should communicate basic information about what to do during an emergency, and the status of restoration efforts.
</li>
<li>
<strong>If you have power, </strong>
charge your cell phones, laptops, and other mobile devices so they'll have the maximum amount of battery power stored in the event of a power outage. These devices will help you communicate with your power company, and they'll help you stay informed about restoration efforts, weather forecasts, and other important information.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep spare batteries and a car charger for your phone.</strong>
If you use your car to recharge your phone, be sure your car is in a well-ventilated place and remove it from the garage, but do not move your car until any danger has passed. You can also listen to your car radio for important news alerts.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Subscribe to text alert services</strong>
from government officials, to receive alerts in the event of a disaster.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep a list </strong>
of emergency, family, and work contacts.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep all phone calls brief.</strong>
If you need to use a phone, try to convey only vital information to emergency personnel and/or family.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conserve your cell phone battery</strong>
by reducing the brightness of your screen, placing your phone in airplane mode, and closing apps you are not using that draw power.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Refer to Twitter, Facebook, or other social media sites for information.</strong>
Refer to emergency management websites for information.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Refer to petroleum industry associations</strong>
like the Automobile Association of America and GasBuddy.com for information about gasoline and diesel fuel prices.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stay tuned to local media reports.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Seek out information </strong>
from State and local government sources.
</li>
</ul>
